 * Since Spark 2.0, the spark-streaming-kafka connector has 2 flavours : 0.8 and 0.10.
 * 
 * All distributions running on Spark versions prior to 2.0 were running on the 0.8 version... excepted MapR that comes
 * with its own spark-streaming-kafka having its own API to be compilant with both MapR Streams and Kafka (not the
 * Apache version but their own version of Kafka, of course).
 * 
 * Warning : "0.8" does not mean that it was actually compiled against Kafka 0.8... that could be against 0.9 depending
 * of how the vendor packaged the connector.
 * 
 * This enum lists all the current versions of the spark-streaming-kafka connector.
